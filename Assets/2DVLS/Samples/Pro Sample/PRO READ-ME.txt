Make layer called "Light2D" (Does not have to be the same just remember which layer you created)

Duplicate your Main-Camera, rename it LightCam, and delete the 'GUILayer', 'Flare Layer', and 'Audio Listener' components from it.

Add the 'Blur' shader to the LightCam

Set the LightCam settings
- Clear Flags = Solid Color (or Skybox)
- Culling Mask = "Light2D" only
- Depth = -1

Set the Main Camera settings
- Clear Flags = Depth Only
- Culling Mask = (Everything checked except for the 'Light2D' layer
- Depth = 0 (or any value higher than the LightCam depth)

After that you can add your lights and set their layer to "Light2D"
